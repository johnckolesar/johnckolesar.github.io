I am a third-year computer science Ph.D. student at Yale University advised by Professor Ruzica Piskac.  My research interests include automatic program verification, symbolic execution, automatic program repair, and software-defined networking.

In 2020 I received a B.A. from Cornell University, where I majored in both mathematics and classics.  I did computer science research under Professor Nate Foster while at Cornell.  I received an M.S. en route to the Ph.D. from Yale in 2022.

In the summer of 2022, I worked as a research intern at Microsoft One Engineering System.  In the summers of 2018 and 2019, I did software development work for Aretec Inc., a contractor working for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
