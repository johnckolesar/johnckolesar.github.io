I am a third-year computer science Ph.D. student at Yale University advised by Professor Ruzica Piskac.  My research interests include automatic program verification, symbolic execution, automatic program repair, and software-defined networking.

In 2020 I received a B.A. from Cornell University, where I majored in both mathematics and classics.  I did computer science research under Professor Nate Foster while at Cornell.  I received an M.S. en route to the Ph.D. from Yale in 2022.
